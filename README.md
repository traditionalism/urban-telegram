# urban-telegram
My second little 'project' within the rust-lang now using bevy-engine!

### Screenshots
Sorry! I'm lazy and have none.

## Rudiments
```
cargo install cargo-make
```
### Building Native
```
cargo make run
```

### LLD-Linking
urban-telegram deploys LLD Linker to expedite the compilation process. To get rid of LLD-Linking delete `.cargo/config.toml`
